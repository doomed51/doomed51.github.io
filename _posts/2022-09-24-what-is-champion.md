How does one determine a champion, particularly when it is not a level playing field or a level playing field simply isn’t possible?
    
    not possible when?
        - Real life...
        - Generally where “available resources” differ….differ in a way that cannot be changed/overcome by all the parties in competition

Can there be "fair" competition resulting in an objectively undeniable champion where desired outcomes are equal, but the ability to reach them is not? Where the ability to reach them is a function of **availability** [of resources]...

    We should instead define a champion within some defined scope where:
        - Local optima, constrained by availability, are made to be desirable 
        - Local optima result in localized competition 

Thus, with a focus on local optima, we must ask "champion of what"? 

At **what point do the local optima differ enough** to require a different enough skillset that must in turn be **controlled by a different set of characteristics** that require mastery within the local optima? 

**The definition of what it is that must be championed must be specific**. Specific enough to require specific skillsets, but not so specific that there is not enough recognition of the local optima by a given population. 

**Is recognition a requirement of being “a champion”?** SomeTHING or someONE must recognize the attainment of the rank, and reward it. The reward can be isolated from the process of attaining enough mastery to be recognized as a champion. The process in and of itself could be recognized as a local optima (but typically is not).
