### How does one determine a champion? 

Particularly when it is not a level playing field or a level playing field simply isn’t possible
    
    not possible when?
        - real life...
        - generally where “available resources” differ….differ in a way that cannot be changed/overcome by the parties in competition

    what this means is that:
        - the desired  outcomes remain the same / similar but the ability to reach them differs where ability is a function of availability….(of resources)
        - Local optima become desirable 
        - Local optima result in localized competition 

Thus, we must ask, champion of what? At **what point do the local optima differ enough** to require a different enough skillset that must in turn be **controlled by a different set of characteristics** that determine mastery within the local optima? 

**The definition of what it is that must be championed must be specific**. 

And it is important to differentiate reward from attaining the mastery to be champion. 

**Is recognition a requirement of being “a champion”?** SomeTHING or someONE must recognize the attainment of the rank, and reward it. The reward can and should be isolated from the process of attaining the mastery to be recognized as a champion.
