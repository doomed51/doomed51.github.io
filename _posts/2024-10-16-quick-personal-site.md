### Two Principles for Building Useful Things
> Develop, deploy, iterate. 

and 

> The market can stay irrational longer than you can remain funded. 


This means **we must test things in the cheapest way possible** because the market dictates what is rational. Deploying quickly makes things even cheaper.

### The Steps

The cheapest landing page consists of a (free) github account, and optionally a (paid) custom domain.

##### Overview: 

1. Sign up for a [github account](https://github.com/signup/) (the account name will be in the URL so keep that in mind if not purchasing a custom domain)
2. Create repo 
    - menu > 'Your repositories' > new
    - Repository name has to be `<<account_name>>.github.io`
    - Make sure `Public` is selected 
3. Setup [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site) 
4. Build out the custom landing page in Markdown 

The beautiful thing about this is that **no prior coding experience is required**. Github handles all the html generation so you can focus on the content. You just need to invest 20-30 mins into learning [git](https://wizardzines.com/git-cheat-sheet.pdf) and [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). 

Here is a (cheatsheet for Markdown)[yyhttps://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/]
