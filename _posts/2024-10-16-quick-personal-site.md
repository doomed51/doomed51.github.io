Develop, deploy, iterate. This is how progress is made, how big things are built. 

The market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent. 

This means we must test things in the cheapest way possible. Doing it quickly makes it even cheaper. 

The cheapest landing page consists of a (free) github account, and optionally a (paid) custom domain.

Overview: 

1. Sign up for a github account (the account name will be in the URL so keep that in mind if not purchasing a custom domain)
2. create repo <account_name>.github.io
3. setup Github Pages 
4. build out the custom landing page 

The beautiful this about this is no real coding experience is required. Github handles all the html generation so you can focus on the content. 

Optionally:

- setup custom domain 
- Use jekyll static page generation
