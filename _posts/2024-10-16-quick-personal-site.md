### Two Principles for Building Useful Things
> Develop, deploy, iterate. 

and 

> The market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent. 


This means **we must test things in the cheapest way possible**. Deploying quickly makes things even cheaper.

### The Steps

The cheapest landing page consists of a (free) github account, and optionally a (paid) custom domain.

##### Overview: 

1. Sign up for a github account (the account name will be in the URL so keep that in mind if not purchasing a custom domain)
2. Create repo <account_name>.github.io
3. Setup Github Pages 
4. Build out the custom landing page 

The beautiful thing about this is that **no prior coding experience is required**. Github handles all the html generation so you can focus on the content. You just need to invest ~1-2hrs into learning git 

##### Optionally:

- Setup custom domain 
- Use jekyll static page generation
