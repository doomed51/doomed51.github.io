Highlights for the paper [Option Volume Imbalance as a Predictor...](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4019647)


### Insights 
- ...deep out-of-the-money options had the highest predictive power, as well as data
that came from customers who traded using full-service brokerage house (Pan and Poteshman, 2006)

- ...option volume flow metric was defined by [ Hu, 2014 ], who used delta-adjusted volumes and showed its significant predictive power for stock returns. 

- ... found that the predictability of future returns is stronger for assets with a higher ratio of informed traders, low analyst coverage, large bid-ask spreads, small market capitalization, and low institutional ownership.

- cross MPCs, higher Gamma options/higher Gamma buckets (corresponding to ATM
options) tend to perform better

- Results are not as clear with moneyness buckets, with no consistent pattern followed by the buckets, except that the 1st bucket is outperformed by the rest, hinting that **deep OTM options have the lowest informational content**

- no consistent pattern can be observed across MPCs for the different maturity buckets, indicating  that maturity has no effect on predictability

- We can clearly observe that put options play a more important role in predicting future returns compared to call options...
    - Across all MPCs, the first bucket for Delta (consisting mostly of ITM put options) outperforms the other buckets...
    - Customers, the 1st bucket significantly outperforms the other buckets

- For all of Brokers, Market Makers, and Customers, **higher implied volatility results in higher predictability**
    - Similarly to the volume weighted betting scheme, we consider a strategy based on the product’s volume, multiplied by the implied volatility of the asset. We set the IV-Volume Weighting Scheme

- For Vega, no consistent pattern can be observed across MPCs. Thus, while implied volatility plays a big role in determining the informational content of an option’s volume, the sensitivity of options to implied volatility does not

### Conclusions  
- for Customers most of the predictability comes from the selling activity

- option characteristics that seem to consistently induce higher performance include negative values for Rho, and negative values for Delta (i.e put options)

-  the OVI from high implied volatility contracts is significantly more informative than option contracts with low implied volatility
