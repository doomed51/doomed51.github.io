Core principles:

> learning results in a change in behavior 

and 

> Making mistakes is a big part of learning 

Think of that last thing you spent time learning. Maybe perfecting a new recipe, or deploying something useful to production. My guess is at some point there were a few bad meals, a handful of garbled configs…things were, objectively, wasted. 

How about that last morals and ethics eLearning you did…any waste out of that(other than maybe your time, dear cynical reader)? no? and did you learn anything? 

Learning something generates waste. Whether it’s food, or paper, or **effort**, there is going to be waste. 

If there is no waste, there likely had not been much learning going on.

And if you need to measure learning for some reason, as hard it is to measure the change in behavior, it is much easier to measure waste generated [by a process].
