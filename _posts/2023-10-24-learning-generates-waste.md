Core principles:

> Learning is a change in behavior 

and 

> Mistakes are a natural part of the learning process  

Think back to the last time you were trying to learn something. Maybe it was perfecting a new recipe or deploying something complex to production. Odds are, somewhere along the way, you had a few kitchen disasters or encountered some botched configs that, from an efficiency standpoint, were wasted time and resources.

Now, contrast that with THE Nth time you were required to comple an ethics/compliance eLearning course. How much “waste” did that generate? Aside from a block of your time, probably not much. Did your behaviour change as a result of doing the course again? 

While we can learn *about* something fairly quickly and efficiently, actually learning - applying that thing, by its very nature, generates waste. Whether it’s in the form of discarded ingredients, crumpled paper, used up equipment, there’s always something left behind, something used up for the practice we need to change how we behave, how we DO something. 

Tracking tangible changes in behavior can sometimes be challenging. Tracking *waste* produced by the learning process can provide a simpler method of identifying progress with respect to learning something, of a change in behavior. This isn't to say that any waste generated means learning, but by focusing on the waste two things happen

1. It becomes easier to accept waste generation as part of the change process 

and 

2. You can begin to direct what kind of waste is generated, and thusly what kind of behaviors are changed 

The next time you see those wasted resources, consider how you can use it to measure change towards your goal.
